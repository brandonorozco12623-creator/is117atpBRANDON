Your first appointment is about getting to know each other. We'll discuss what
brought you to therapy, your goals, and answer any questions. There's no
pressure - it's a safe space to share at your own pace.

This varies by individual and concern. Some people benefit from short-term
focused therapy (8-12 sessions), while others prefer ongoing support. We'll work
together to determine what's best for you.

Yes. Everything discussed in therapy is strictly confidential, with limited
exceptions required by law (risk of harm to self/others, suspected child/elder
abuse).

We accept most major insurance plans including Blue Cross Blue Shield, Aetna,
Cigna, UnitedHealthcare, and Medicare. We also offer self-pay options.

We require 24-hour notice for cancellations. Late cancellations or no-shows may
